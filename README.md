##### Description
In the first semester of IFSP, I completed an individual evaluation project where the main focus was to create a list of exercises called "arsenal" and solve them using code and diagrams. The objective was to present the final solution to the instructor. It is important to note that all exercises were chosen by the student and the professor provided feedback on the level of difficulty, suggesting additional exercises as needed.
